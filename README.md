# Join Their Journey with Music

##### A full stack app that helps caregivers interact, connect, and record standardized data on those suffering from dementia.

---

I wanted to create an app that would help solve the problem of how caretakers could positively connect with their Dementia patients as well as could measure and record those interactions to show trends over time. Studies have shown finding music that connects with patients improves patient outcome. Join Their Journey with Music leverages that information to helps caregivers select music with meaning for dementia patients and also has the functionality to measures specific aspects of a patient's response to a song to collect data points that can referenced over a patient's journey with dementia.

### Getting Started

> Make sure you have the Django Api up and running before launching the Front-End.

### Closing Thoughts

With music becoming much more easily accessible through streaming platforms, more than ever music is a low investment with a high return on patient quality of life and caregiver stress levels. Music can be used to entertain, help redirect a patient when they are upset, scared or confused, and has been shown to make a patient more manageable when dealing with daily tasks such as bathing or other personal care interactions. I will continue to improve upon this Prototype with more input and research from professionals working with Dementia patients.

## ###Thank You

I wanted to thank all the health professional who took the time to discuss my App with me. I look forward to continuing those relationships and further improving my App.
